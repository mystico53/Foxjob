---

Hello AWS SES Team,

Thank you for reviewing our production access request. I'm happy to provide additional details about my email sending practices for this hobby project.

## About Foxjob
Foxjob (https://foxjob.io) is a personal hobby project - a job matching platform that I'm developing to help users find job opportunities. It uses AI to match job seekers with relevant positions based on their skills and preferences.

## Email Sending Details

### Frequency and Volume
- **Current volume**: 5-20 emails per day (very small hobby project)
- **Expected growth**: 50-200 emails per day maximum (if the project grows)
- **Sending frequency**: Occasional job notifications for test users
- **Peak times**: Low volume throughout the day

### Email Types I Send
1. **Job Match Notifications (Most emails)**
   - Simple job recommendations for test users
   - Basic match information
   
2. **Basic Transactional Emails**
   - Account verification
   - Password resets
   - Simple welcome messages

### Sample Email Content
Here's an example of my main email type:

**Subject**: "New Job Matches Available - Foxjob"

**Content Structure**:
- Simple greeting
- 1-3 job matches with basic information
- Link to view more details
- Clear unsubscribe option
- Simple HTML template

## Recipient List Management

### List Building
- **Opt-in only**: Users sign up voluntarily during registration
- **Email verification**: Required during account creation

### List Maintenance

- **Simple approach**: Basic list management for hobby project

## Bounce and Complaint Management

### Bounce Handling
- **Hard bounces**: Remove immediately from my small list
- **Monitor carefully**: Watch AWS SES metrics
- **Low volume**: Easy to manage manually

### Complaint Management

## Compliance and Best Practices

### Legal Compliance

## Project Goals
This is a personal learning project where I:

## Additional Information

- **Committed to quality**: No spam, only valuable content

This is a genuine hobby project where I'm learning about email delivery and job matching. I'm committed to following all best practices and AWS policies.
